from utpay_client import UTPayClient

# Initialize UTPayClient
utpay_client = UTPayClient(api_key='your_api_key', base_url='https://api.utpay.com')

# Create an order
order_data = {'currency': 'USD', 'amount': 100, 'customerId': '123456789'}
order_response = utpay_client.create_order(order_data)

Methods of Improvement:
Enhanced Error Handling:

Further refine error handling to provide detailed error messages and instructions for resolution.
Implement specific exception classes for better error categorization.
Parameter Validation:

Add parameter validation to ensure that the input data for order initiation meets the expected format and constraints.
Unit Testing:

Develop unit tests to verify the functionality of individual methods and classes.
Utilize testing frameworks such as pytest for comprehensive testing.
Configurability:

Externalize configuration parameters (API key, authentication details, etc.) to a separate configuration file for better flexibility and security.
Structural Components:
UtPayHandler Class:

Manages the integration with utPay API.
Handles request/response logging, error handling, and initiation of fiat-to-crypto orders.
Logger:

Configures a logger to record important events during script execution.
Logs are organized by date in a 'logs' directory for easy access.
Order Initiation Method:

The initiate_order method within UtPayHandler is responsible for initiating a fiat-to-crypto order.
Demonstrates the use of the utPay API by constructing the request payload and handling the API response.
Usage Example:
python
Copy code
# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        # Instantiate UtPayHandler with API key, auth SID, and auth nonce
        utpay_handler = UtPayHandler(api_key="your_api_key", auth_sid="your_auth_sid", auth_nonce="123456")

        # Initiate order
        utpay_handler.initiate_order()

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
Note for Beginners:
This script serves as a foundation for integrating your application with the utPay API
