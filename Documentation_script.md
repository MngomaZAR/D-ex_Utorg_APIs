his script provides a simple integration with the utPay API for initiating orders. It is designed to be a starting point for developers looking to integrate utPay functionality into their applications. The script includes error handling, logging, and modularization for clarity and maintainability.

Use Case Examples:

Initiating an Order:
Use the UtPayHandler class to initiate a fiat-to-crypto order.
The script logs the request and response details, providing visibility into the communication with the utPay API.
Handle errors gracefully and log relevant information for troubleshooting.

## Installation

Before using the UTPayClient, make sure you have the required dependencies installed. You can install them using the following commands:

1. Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install requests
Clone the UTPayClient repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/UTPayClient.git
cd UTPayClient
Install the UTPayClient package:
bash
Copy code
pip install .
Alternatively, you can install the UTPayClient directly from GitHub:

bash
Copy code
pip install git+https://github.com/your-username/UTPayClient.git
Usage
To use the UTPayClient in your Python project, follow these steps:

python
Copy code
from utpay_client import UTPayClient

# Initialize UTPayClient
utpay_client = UTPayClient(api_key='your_api_key', base_url='https://api.utpay.com')

# Create an order
order_data = {'currency': 'USD', 'amount': 100, 'customerId': '123456789'}
order_response = utpay_client.create_order(order_data)
print("Created Order:", order_response)

# Get order details
order_id = order_response.get('orderId')
if order_id:
    order_details = utpay_client.get_order_details(order_id)
    print("Order Details:", order_details)

# List all orders
all_orders = utpay_client.list_orders()
print("All Orders:", all_orders)

# Update an order (assuming 'order_id' is valid)
if order_id:
    update_data = {'amount': 150}
    updated_order = utpay_client.update_order(order_id, update_data)
    print("Updated Order:", updated_order)

# Cancel an order (assuming 'order_id' is valid)
if order_id:
    cancellation_result = utpay_client.cancel_order(order_id)
    print("Cancellation Result:", cancellation_result)
API Reference
UTPayClient Class
__init__(self, api_key, base_url)
Initializes the UTPayClient with the provided API key and base URL.

api_key: The API key for authentication.
base_url: The base URL of the UTPay API.
create_order(self, data)
Creates a new order with the provided data.

data: A dictionary containing order details (e.g., 'currency', 'amount', 'customerId').
get_order_details(self, order_id)
Retrieves details for a specific order.

order_id: The ID of the order to retrieve details for.
list_orders(self)
Lists all orders.

update_order(self, order_id, data)
Updates an existing order with the provided data.

order_id: The ID of the order to update.
data: A dictionary containing updated order details.
cancel_order(self, order_id)
Cancels an existing order.

order_id: The ID of the order to cancel.

Methods of Improvement:

Enhanced Error Handling:

Further refine error handling to provide detailed error messages and instructions for resolution.
Implement specific exception classes for better error categorization.
Parameter Validation:

Add parameter validation to ensure that the input data for order initiation meets the expected format and constraints.
Unit Testing:

Develop unit tests to verify the functionality of individual methods and classes.
Utilize testing frameworks such as pytest for comprehensive testing.
Configurability:

Externalize configuration parameters (API key, authentication details, etc.) to a separate configuration file for better flexibility and security.
Structural Components:

UtPayHandler Class:

Manages the integration with utPay API.
Handles request/response logging, error handling, and initiation of fiat-to-crypto orders.
Logger:

Configures a logger to record important events during script execution.
Logs are organized by date in a 'logs' directory for easy access.
Order Initiation Method:

The initiate_order method within UtPayHandler is responsible for initiating a fiat-to-crypto order.
Demonstrates the use of the utPay API by constructing the request payload and handling the API response.
Usage Example:

python
Copy code
# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        # Instantiate UtPayHandler with API key, auth SID, and auth nonce
        utpay_handler = UtPayHandler(api_key="your_api_key", auth_sid="your_auth_sid", auth_nonce="123456")

        # Initiate order
        utpay_handler.initiate_order()

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
Note for Beginners:
This script serves as a foundation for integrating your application with the utPay API. It is organized into a class (UtPayHandler) for better structure and readability. Key concepts like error handling, logging, and initiating an order are explained through comments. Remember to replace placeholder values (e.g., "your_api_key") with your actual credentials.

To enhance the script further, consider exploring topics like unit testing, parameter validation, and configuration management as your understanding of Python development deepens. The goal is to make the script adaptable, secure, and easy to maintain as your integration needs evolve.
